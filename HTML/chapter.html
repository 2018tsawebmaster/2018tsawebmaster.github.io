			<h4>Our Motto</h4>
			<p>Learning to lead in a technical world.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aboutOdd">
			<h4>Our Creed</h4>
			<p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>

			<h4>Our History</h4>
			<p>OCSA TSA has attended several state and national conferences. We have come home with several first, second, and third place trophies at the state and national level in events such as prepared presentation, children's stories, chapter team, fashion design, and music production to name a few. As a chapter, we have placed in the top ten overall numerous times at the state conference. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="aboutOdd">
			<h4>Our Chapter Activities</h4>
			<p>Our chapter participates in many volunteer oppurtunities inside and out of our school. Many of our chapter members are also involved in National Honor Society and are therefore constantly trying to help around the community. Some community service events that OCSA TSA has participated in include collecting beans and nonparishable items for the less fortunate and advising members of the community to donate to the American Cancer Society, a close partner of TSA.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aboutEven">
			<h4>Our Plans for the Future</h4>
	   		<p> OCSA TSA plans to continue to expand and branch out to more people in our school as well as attempting to spread TSA to other schools in our county who may not have heard about our organization and its social and educational benefits. We also plan to encourage our chapter officers to run for state office and strive to gain leadership positions inside and out of TSA.Finally, we will strive to educate our peers about the STEAM field so that we can all lead the technical world one day. </p>
