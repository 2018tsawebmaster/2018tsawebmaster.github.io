    <h2 id= "usesAndBenefitsHeader">Uses and benefits of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
	<div id="usesAndBenefitsDescription">
		<p>Artificial Intelligence and machine learning is the most important and versatile technology of our era. Machine learning is the machine’s ability to keep improving without human interaction and involvement in the tasks being performed. Within just the past few years machine learning has become far more effective and widely available. Using machine learning and AI, we are now able to build systems that are able to accomplish major feats on their own. On the business side of things, AI is expected to have an enormous impact on the scale of general-purpose technologies. Although it is already in use in thousands of companies around the globe, most of the major opportunities of Artificial Intelligence have not yet been tapped. The effects of AI will be magnified in the coming years, as fields such as manufacturing, retailing, transportation, finance, health care, law, advertising, insurance, entertainment, education, and virtually every other industry transform their core processes and business models to reap the benefits of machine learning.

		So far, the biggest advances in the artificial intelligence field have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Regarding perception, some of the most practical advances have been made in relation to speech. Voice recognition has not yet been perfected, however, millions of people are now using it software such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. A study by the Stanford computer scientist James Landay and colleagues found that speech recognition is now about three times as fast, on average, as typing on a cell phone. The error rate, once 8.5%, has dropped to 4.9%. Image recognition, too, has improved drastically. Apps like Facebook are now able to recognize the faces of their users based on photos that both you, and your friends have posted and it will tag them in your pictures accordingly. There are also apps that are able to recognize animals in the wild. Not only is Apple using this technology to unlock their phones, many companies are replacing key cards in favor of image recognition. This technology is also being used in self-driving cars in order to recognize pedestrians.

		The second type of major improvement in AI has been in cognition and problem solving. Machines are have already beat the best poker players. This is an achievement that many experts had predicted would take at least another decade. Google’s DeepMind team has used ML systems to improve the cooling efficiency at data centers by more than 15%, even after they were optimized by the human experts. Artificial intelligence is also being used by the cybersecurity company Deep Instinct for malware detection and by the company PayPal in efforts to prevent money laundering. ML systems are also being used to decide which trades they should execute on Wall Street and for many important credit decisions. With more and more companies using artificial intelligence as a means of prediction and analytics, we could see a greater reliance on this growing technology in the near, and distant future.

	<h2 id= "safetyAndCostsHeader">Safety and Costs</h2>
	<div id="safetyAndCostsDescription">
		<p id="costsParagraph">Incorporating Machine Learning into a company's product can be very expensive, which  is one major downfall. Some firms may see this risk to be greater than the reward, seeing as AI technology is not very advanced as of the present day. The price of integrating AI software into a small company is roughly $100,000 to $300,000. Additionally, Voice recognition technology costs companies like Apple and Amazon millions of dollars. </p>
		<p id = "safetyParagraph">More and more companies are beginning to invest in AI in order to create experiences that have already raised customer expectations. However, AI doesn't just happen and must be treated with the utmost diligence and carefulness. In the coming decades, businesses must be responsible to curate, select, evaluate and fine-tune models that are meant to accurately understand and explain specific situations. If businesses fail to take Artificial Intelligence seriously, they could end up facing public humiliation and financially crippling lawsuits. Any AI algorithm that is based on faulty knowledge or reasoning can mean life and death specifically incases such as manufacturing and in self-driving cars. In a best case scenario, a faulty model will result in customers abandoning a product or a mass recall in widespread cases. In summary, without quality control by human employees, it is dangerous to rely on artificial intelligence at its current state because in the event of a mistake, the fallout could be catastrophic. 
		Daniel Kroening, a professor of computer science at the University of Oxford and founder of the Artificial Intelligence company DiffBlue, has spoken on the unpredictability of AI. "The unpredictable and complex nature of AI presents one of the biggest challenges for humans in understanding its behavior.Therefore, we need to develop AI that will
		be highly intelligent, but transparent enough for humans to understand its complex decisions.”

		Two of the largest concerns posed by society for artificial intelligence are:
		</p>
		<ol class="orderedList">
			<li class="orderedItems">	
			When AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong individuals, these weapons could easily act as weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to override and turnoff so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation and the AI could go rogue. This risk is one that is present even with our limited AI technology now but will grow as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase over time.
			</li>			
			<li class="orderedItems">	
			When AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive and possibly catastrophic method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever companies fail to ensure that the AI and its maker are on the same page. If you ask an obedient intelligent self-driving car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there being tailed in a high speed pursuit by authorities because you are going 50 mph above the speed limit, case in point, the car will take your request extremely literally. The threat of Artificial Intelligence to take our request to the extreme is a frightening one and most be combatted with diligent research and testing before companies put our lives and the lives of others at risk.
